## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Eager to expand and apply my knowledge within the data analysis field.

I am self-taught in MS Excel, Power BI & MySQL.
Looking forward to learning Tableau & Python.

For my practise portfolio, I have:

Designed and created a MySQL database for a travel flight booking system to generate flight tickets for customers. This provided me with insight into how models and databases work.

Produced a Power BI report on customer data to showcase relationships between age groups, customer points and location. This has helped me build up confidence in constructing visuals and analysis of data.

Conducted data analysis on employee data in Excel using formulas & PowerPivot tables.
